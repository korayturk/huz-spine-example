# REACT SPINE CARD

huz-ui-spine has @editor/assets folder which contains two [spine](http://esotericsoftware.com/) 2d skeletons, powerup, and raptor. Each skeleton has some animations like run, jump and etc.

Our target is to give new UX experience to users by using 2d skeletons and dom elements. So we wish to create a spine card displaying all available animations for each skeleton. A spine card can play the animation a user selected. All extra features are welcome.

To use a 2d spine skeleton please check it [here](http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-runtimes).

Good lucks!
